# Matrix-factorization-for-recommendations

# Description:
Matrix Factorization is a powerful technique used in recommendation systems, especially in collaborative filtering. It decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into lower-rank matrices to uncover latent factors (features) that explain observed ratings.

We’ll implement Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a common matrix factorization technique, to generate recommendations based on latent factors.

# ✅ What It Does:
* Simulates a user-item ratings matrix

* Performs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for matrix factorization

* Reconstructs the ratings matrix to generate latent factors

* Recommends unrated items for User1 based on the predicted ratings
